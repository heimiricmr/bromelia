## The Reason Behind

*bromelia* has breathed for the first time to give a Pythonic way for manipulating Diameter protocol structures. Since there is a bunch of ways to handle the well-known HTTP protocol in an elegant fashion in Python, it lacks the same with Diameter.

It is designed to allow at least (but not limited to) five use cases:

 1. Automate tests on Diameter-based mobile network platforms, such as 4G EPC and IMS networks,
 2. Unlock front-end applications to interact with Diameter-based mobile network applications,
 3. Inspect real Diameter traffic to extract relevant information,
 4. Translate and interwork between Diameter and other telco protocols (2G/3G MAP e 5G HTTP/2 SBI),
 5. Just have some fun.

It makes pretty easy and straightforward to start building the basic Diameter structures such as AVPs and Messages and send them down to/receive from the wire.

*bromelia* is powered with all AVPs and Messages defined in RFC 6733 (and more!).

For debugging and research purpose, it is also possible to create Diameter objects with raw bytes (eg. captured from network interfaces with both tcpdump and tshark tools).

Last but not least, the *bromelia* is extensivily tested using `unittest` and require only one third-party package ([pyyaml](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)) which is used for parse the YAML config file in the `Bromelia` class. The test suite are a good source of knownledge and documentation, where you may find examples on how to use each object and functions [here](tests/).

[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/bromelia.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/bromelia)

## Installation

Install and update using `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U Bromelia
```

Dependencies can be installed using pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run unittests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/*.py
python3 -m unittest tests/avps/etsi_3gpp*/*.py
python3 -m unittest tests/avps/ietf*/*.py
python3 -m unittest tests/lib/etsi_3gpp*/*.py
```

Then after setting up the config file as per explained in the [Tutorials](#tutorials) section, you can run the Diameter application by issuing the Python interpreter. Keep in mind there are two ways to spin up a Diameter application: either with Diameter class or Bromelia class.

## Simple Diameter class example

Find more information on how to run a simple Diameter class example in [examples/diameter-app1/README.md](examples/diameter-app1/README.md).

#: Basic Diameter object config
config = {

app = Diameter(config=config)

#: Basic DiameterAVPs for ULR message
avps = [
            SessionIdAVP(LOCAL_HOSTNAME),
            AuthSessionStateAVP(NO_STATE_MAINTAINED),

            UserNameAVP("123456789123456"),
            RatTypeAVP(RAT_TYPE_EUTRAN),
            UlrFlagsAVP(3)
]

#: Create ULR message
ulr = DiameterRequest(command_code=316, application_id=16777251)
ulr.extend(avps)

#: Setup Diameter connection, send ULR & receive ULA
with app.context():
    while app.is_open():
        ula = app.send_message(ulr)
        break
```
